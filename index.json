However, current algorithms show unstable performance on variable data and specific imaging methods, e.g., Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM). This study presents a workflow from 4D reconstruction to 3D segmentation and single-cell analysis, with datasets of 48-hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryonic hearts. Contributions conclude two innovative segmentation backbones: one integrates 3D U-Net with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), named 3D U-KANs; the other develops a 3D ResNet50 Encoder, achieving accuracy improvements of 2 and 4 percentage points, respectively, suited for LSFM especially. Precise segmentation results enable single-cell tracking and analysis, making sense for pathological assessments and promising insights to represent functional changes and regional biomechanics during cardiac development and regeneration.\nKEY WORDS: Machine Learning, 4D Reconstruction, Segmentation, Tracking, Zebrafish, Single-cell Analysis Introduction Cardiac structure and function rely on the coordination between cells [1]. Therefore, investigating the movement and mechanical properties at the single-cell level [2] is crucial for assessing normal and pathological hearts. Zebrafish has been widely used in cardiovascular research, serving as an excellent model to dissect the genetic and developmental underpinnings due to its transparency, genetic similarities and tractability [3]. Advanced imaging systems, such as Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM), further facilitate cardiovascular research. LSFM, as shown in Fig.1 (A), enables multi-scale imaging with high temporal resolution and low phototoxicity [4], making it ideal for capturing dynamic behavior in living hearts. Recent studies on LSFM demonstrate its utility in 4D (3D plus time series, 3D+T) reconstruction, providing powerful tools to quantify and analyze intricate dynamics of the living hearts [6]. Taylor et al. [7] introduced an adaptive prospective optical gating technique, which can continuously capture embryonic zebrafish heart images throughout the day. Liebling et al. [8] developed a post-acquisition synchronization technique that can reconstruct cardiac dynamics from ungated slice sequences, while Mickoleit et al. [9] demonstrated how high-resolution reconstruction can reveal the micro-architecture and functionality of zebrafish hearts.\nWith in vivo imaging advancements, numerous analytical tools are designed to explore cellular dynamics within 3D volumes. DeepCell 2.0 [10], 3DeeCellTracker [11], and Cellpose [12] are automated pipelines for cell segmentation and tracking. Frameworks like FlowNet [13] and FlowNet 2.0 [14] also provide robust tracking, specifically designed for rapid and irregular cellular movements. These methods are all comprehensive toolkits developed for dynamic analysis at the single-cell level, suited for cardiac development and function research.\nHowever, densely packed and rapidly moving cells severely challenge this single-cell analysis in 3D+T images, which relies heavily on accurate 3D segmentation. The U-Net [15] has become the cornerstone of medical segmentation since 2015, which leverages an encoder-decoder structure to capture local features and reconstruct them into precise segmentation maps. However, traditional convolution shows significant limitations [16] when facing difficulties [17], such as complex shapes of organs and tissues, highly nonlinear relationships between anatomical regions, and the noise introduced by imaging processes and sample motion, especially for modeling among 3D volumes. Additionally, preparing training data is challenging [18], especially for specific imaging conditions, and parameter optimization is often inevitable for different samples [11], even within the same optical system.\nTo address the gap and match LSFM characteristics, this study introduces two innovative segmentation backbones. The first integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) [19] into a 3D U-Net [20], forming a new architecture named 3D U-KANs. The second develops a 3D ResNet50 [21] Encoder to extract features. Both are trained on the self-constructed dataset, specifically for the LSFM imaging system.\nThe main contributions of this study are summarized as follows:\n3D U-KANs is the first network to integrate KANs into U-Net architecture for 3D medical image segmentation; 3D ResNet50 Encoder replaces the traditional downsampling and upsampling process, reducing the network complexity.\nAccuracy tests on multi-sample datasets show performance improvement with 2 percentage points for 3D U-KANs and 4 points for 3D ResNet50 Encoder, and great generalization, especially for the LSFM system. Tracking and single-cell analysis based on the segmented volumes further verify their effectiveness and application value.\nThe study implements a pipeline, integrating high-dimensional …","date":1727395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727395200,"objectID":"3872c15b287c5b9c7bb446ff972dbd81","permalink":"https://example.com/project/external-project-copy-4/","publishdate":"2024-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project-copy-4/","section":"project","summary":"Master Thesis Project at Imperial College London","tags":["Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Machine learning for 3D segmentation of large datasets to detect normal and pathological hearts","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) integrates experts across fields to deliver comprehensive, personalized treatment plans, particularly enhancing cancer care by improving diagnostic precision and treatment strategies.

In clinical practice, accurate tumor segmentation—providing essential data on tumor size, shape, and volume—is vital for staging and assessing progression, while recurrence and prognosis assessments are crucial for tailoring treatments to patient-specific risks, thus enhancing outcomes and survival rates. Currently, there’s a gap in models capable of simultaneously handling multiple tasks, especially in esophageal cancer diagnosis and treatment, where interactions between tasks lack thorough exploration.

Quantification and model transplantation for the human feature extraction step are performed based on an artificial intelligence chip.\nTo complete the human feature extraction, a humanoid target detector is first built based on the YOLOv5s framework and DeepSORT tracking, and a pose estimation detector is built to extract human bone joint points using the Alphapose algorithm. The extracted features are then fed into the action classification detector based on convolution of spatio-temporal maps to complete the construction of the human motion recognition system.\nDue to the problems of aerial perspective and complex background of surveillance videos, this work does not use the current mainstream dataset, but uses several high-resolution surveillance cameras from the Experimental Teaching Center of Information and Communication Engineering, School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering, Tianjin University to create a 15-hour dataset with 9 types of actions in 12 indoor and outdoor scenes to train and evaluate the model.

This article adopts the STM32f103zet6 microcontroller and uses embedded development design to add functions such as ultrasonic obstacle avoidance, GPS positioning, fall detection, fingerprint unlocking, and voice broadcasting to the traditional blind cane. This project utilizes the XFS5152CE chip to achieve voice broadcasting function, the AS608 optical fingerprint module to achieve fingerprint unlocking function, the ESP8266WiFi module to achieve interaction between mobile phones and intelligent guide canes, the ADXL345 module to detect the user’s status in real-time, and to achieve fall warning function. The ultrasonic obstacle avoidance module utilizes the principle of ultrasonic ranging. The GPS positioning module can receive and demodulate the broadcast C/A code signal of satellites, and achieve GPS positioning function by calculating the pseudo distance to each satellite and calculating parameters such as longitude and latitude. The feasibility of this scheme has been verified through experiments. Fingerprint unlocking, voice broadcasting, and GPS positioning functions can all operate normally. When the distance between the guide rod and the obstacle is less than 0.2m, or the forward acceleration in a certain direction of the guide rod is too large, the intelligent guide rod can send out a warning signal in a timely manner.\nKEY WORDS: STM32 microcontroller, intelligent blind cane, ultrasonic ranging, GPS, embedded Introduction 1.1 Project Overview 1.1.1 Introduction to the Project\nAs one of the assistive tools for mobility, guide canes are widely used among the blind community. In today’s technologically advanced world, the trend towards product intelligence is undeniable. Taking into consideration the overall environment of the pandemic and the daily mobility needs of the blind, this project is dedicated to designing an intelligent guide cane to further facilitate the mobility of the blind. By adding only a small amount of cost, the guide cane is equipped with an ultrasonic obstacle avoidance system, a GPS positioning system, a fall detection with one-click alarm feature, a display screen that can show personal health codes and payment codes, a voice broadcast for daily weather forecasts, and a fingerprint lock to protect important personal information such as health codes and payment codes.\n1.2 Project Plan 1.2.1 Background of the Project\nAccording to statistics from the Ministry of Health, there are as many as 14 million blind people in China, making it the country with the highest number of blind individuals in the world. On average, there is one blind person in every 100 individuals. Every year, about 450,000 new cases of blindness and visually impaired individuals are reported in China, highlighting an urgent need to address their mobility issues. The factors affecting the lives of the blind mainly include the following:\nFirst, the physical defects of the blind lead to many disadvantages in their lives; Second, due to mobility challenges, the blind find it difficult to interact with the outside world, lacking in entertainment and social interactions. Third, due to their physical disabilities, the blind face unequal treatment in social work and interpersonal interactions compared to sighted individuals.\nDue to visual impairments, the blind community has developed a communication mode different from sighted individuals for perceiving the world and conveying information.\nSurveys show that only 27% of blind individuals go out daily, 55% of them are unable to distinguish directions while traveling, and 34% worry about colliding with obstacles during their journeys. The survey concluded that the main reason for the low mobility of blind individuals is the lack of a comprehensive transportation system and friendly navigation devices, along with the low utilization rate of blind paths. There is a general desire among the blind for friendly mobility tools to ensure their safety, a dedicated transportation system for the blind, and the introduction of high-tech products for better navigation and assistance.\n1.2.2 Significance of the Project\nFirstly, the inability of the blind to easily venture outdoors hinders their interaction with the external world. Products such as blind navigators can facilitate their mobility, increase safety, and make their travels less tedious, thereby helping blind individuals integrate into modern intelligent life.\nSecondly, in the context of big data, artificial intelligence, and 5G, relying on advanced scientific and technological means to solve the mobility issues of the blind is of great significance. The blind hope to be treated equally by others, to not be isolated, and to participate in social life and activities just like sighted people.

Then set the upper limit value in the program, and the buzzer will alarm when the upper limit value is exceeded.\nIn the simulation part, a light bulb and a photoresistor are used to simulate a light sensor. The voltage across the photoresistor is obtained to represent the light intensity. Then an operational amplifier is used to make the change in light intensity and voltage within a certain range have a linear relationship. At this time, the light obtained Strong is just an analog value, which is then input to the PF0 port of ATmega64 for the next step of analog-to-digital conversion; in addition, similar to the photosensitive part, the temperature sensitive part uses a light bulb plus a thermosensitive resistor to simulate the temperature sensor; the humidity part uses pulse voltage frequency simulation Humidity, the humidity value we obtain at this time is already a digital quantity, which can be directly input into the PD6 port of ATmega64. The quantities we input will be used for subsequent display on the LM016L and for alarming when the set threshold is exceeded.\nIn addition, in the output part, we use LM016L for display, which displays digital quantities, and then switches the display and sets the alarm threshold through buttons.\nFor the working voltage part, except the buzzer alarm which uses DC +12V voltage, the rest uses the DC +5V voltage output by LM7805. Then the working voltage of ATmega64 is 4.5V to 5.5V, the working voltage of temperature and humidity sensor is 5V, the maximum working voltage of photodiode is generally 10 to 50V, the best working voltage of LM016L module is 5V, whichever of the above devices can work The voltage is 5V as the supply voltage. And due to the limitations of the device LM016L, the operating current is 2mA.\nElectrical schematic diagram: Printed board diagram: ","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"fe9725e95dab45066056cc1b7015b18b","permalink":"https://example.com/project/external-project-copy-5/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project-copy-5/","section":"project","summary":"Proteus electronic system design and simulation during undergraduate","tags":["Electronic"],"title":"Temperature and humidity alarm \u0026 light intensity display","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I. Functionality Transmitter Side: The user inputs the mathematical expression to be calculated through buttons. The expression can include basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (complex calculations can be added similarly). Then, the process of Encoding → Modulating → Sending is executed. After sending, the device immediately enters a waiting mode, awaiting a response from the receiver side.\nReceiver Side: The receiver side is in a waiting state from the start. Upon receiving a signal, it automatically performs demodulation, calculation, encoding, modulation, and then sends a response.\nOther Buttons: The “Carrier 1” and “Carrier 2” buttons can display the waveform of the carrier on the right side of the image. The processes of encoding, modulation, and reception will be shown on the waveform graph on the right side, displaying the time-domain waveform. The introduction button provides a simple explanation of the principles. The “stop” button is used to interrupt detection, and the “out” button is used to exit this window.\nII. Principle and implementation Encoding Source Encoding: As shown in Figure, the wireless calculator is designed with 16 input buttons, which is the 4th power of 2.\nChannel Encoding: Why use Hamming encoding for the information bits? The answer is that Hamming encoding is an efficient linear block code capable of correcting single-bit errors. The 7,4 Hamming code adds three check bits to a group of 4-bit information bits and can correct minor errors through the calculation of syndromes or correction factors. This enhances the communication system’s resistance to interference, as detailed in the textbook on page 261.\nFrame Synchronization and Protection Codes: The purpose of frame synchronization is to determine the sampling moments for each bit. The frame synchronization code here is used to inform the receiving end when the valid information begins and to establish the starting moment for sampling. Barker codes, with their sharp autocorrelation peak, facilitate identification and minimize the likelihood of false synchronization. The receiver’s identification method is also simple, hence the choice of Barker codes as the true synchronization codes.\nGiven the variable length of the information bits transmitted in this system, the receiver cannot determine when to end sampling, so a Barker code is also added at the end to accurately extract the middle information bits. The role of the protection code is to\nprovide energy variation for the receiver to detect energy changes, and to prevent the delay in calculation from omitting useful information bits, offering the computer a buffer time.\nModulation The modulation method is 2FSK.\nFirst, the sampling frequency needs to be determined. It is best if the sampling frequency is consistent with the MATLAB sound function, hence 8000Hz is chosen here.\nNext, determine the bit transmission rate RB. Generally, a lower transmission rate results in higher accuracy but lower efficiency. Thus, a compromise is chosen at 100Hz. Given a sampling frequency of 8000, this means fs=100Hz and each bit is expanded to 80 samples (8000/80 = 100Hz). The normalized frequency is 0.025π, and the time-domain waveform and spectrum of the transmitted bits are as follows:\nThen, determine the frequencies for carrier 1 and carrier 2. When selecting frequencies, it’s important that the main lobes of the frequency spectra for carrier 1 and carrier 2 overlap as little as possible after modulation. The width of the lobes on either side is fs, so there should be a gap of 2fs between the two carrier frequencies. Considering phase continuity, the frequencies should have an even ratio to simplify calculations and programming without the need to consider phase discontinuities. Furthermore, they should be below half the sampling frequency to satisfy the sampling theorem, i.e., below 4000Hz. Hence, 1000Hz and 2000Hz are chosen, with normalized frequencies of 0.25π and 0.5π respectively.\nThe modulation method involves modulating each bit (before expansion) into 80 points (corresponding to a sampling frequency of 8000, or 100Hz). If a bit is 1, then a 2000Hz sine wave repeating 20 times is used as the modulation waveform (2000/20=100Hz); if a bit is 0, then a 1000Hz sine wave repeating 10 times is used (1000/10=100Hz).\nReception and Demodulation It is important to note that the steps for demodulation are the reverse of those for modulation and correspond one-to-one.\nThe reception uses an energy detection method, which is simply a process of multiplying corresponding elements of matrices and summing them up to check if they reach a threshold value. 2FSK Non-coherent Demodulation The choice of non-coherent demodulation for 2FSK arises from the fact that coherent demodulation involves a multiplication process. At the selection stage, non-coherent demodulation was chosen because if it involves multiplication, the chance of coding errors increases …","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"214ce39e09e6b24b4d98c80c1e2670a8","permalink":"https://example.com/project/external-project-copy-7/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project-copy-7/","section":"project","summary":"Communication Principle during undergraduate","tags":["Electronic"],"title":"Wireless calculator design","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I was particularly engaged by the electronic system design courses, since I could build up my practical capability and build on the theoretical. We also the used single chip microcomputer 80C51F020 to generate a digital sine wave that could control the amplitude and frequency changes via keyboard and output stable sine wave by 12-bit DAC. From the design and simulation of the hardware circuit, to the layout and welding of the circuit board, and then to the design and debugging of the software part of the MCU, we designed a digital synthesis signal device.\nSynopsis of Digital Synthesizer Creation Objective and Innovation: At the core of this endeavor was the ambition to construct a digital synthesizer capable of generating sine waves, with enhanced user control over amplitude and frequency modulation. The project’s cornerstone was the adept use of the 80C51F020 microcontroller, showcasing an astute application of digital-to-analog conversion techniques to engineer precise and adjustable electronic signals.\nTechnical Mastery and Application Signal Range and Modulation: The project’s specification to adjust signal frequencies between 1Hz to 100Hz, alongside amplitude variations from 0.3V to 3Vp-p, demonstrates a rigorous and calculated approach to electronic signal manipulation. This precision underscores the team’s dedication to creating adaptable and user-centric electronic solutions.\nMicrocontroller Utilization: Employing the C8051F020’s 12-bit DAC was a strategic choice, spotlighting the project’s innovative use of microcontroller capabilities to ensure signal accuracy. This decision reflects a harmonious fusion of software-driven logic with the tangible dynamics of hardware execution.\nConvergence of Hardware and Software Design Comprehensive System Development: The project narrative delineates the transition from conceptual circuit design to the practical assembly and detailed microcontroller software debugging. This extensive process underscores the team’s proficiency in electronic system realization, encompassing a broad spectrum of engineering skills.\nAdvanced Signal Processing: Utilizing MATLAB for generating sine wave samples and their quantization for DAC implementation is indicative of an advanced approach to signal processing. This methodology bridges theoretical concepts with real-world technological applications, enriching the project’s technical depth.\nDesign requirements (function and indicator description) Signal frequency range: 1Hz-100Hz; step: 1Hz; accuracy: +/-5% (the above indicators are measured at room temperature) Signal amplitude: 0.3V-3Vp-p; step: 0.1V; accuracy: +/-10% (the above indicators are measured at room temperature) Load capacity: can drive 10 ohm pure group load Frequency and amplitude can be displayed through LED digital tube (can be displayed alternately through indicator lights) Effective when the keyboard is raised System hardware schematic diagram The following figure shows the simulation schematic diagram on Tina Key technical points of hardware modules DAC module This experiment uses C8051F020 built-in 12-bit voltage output DAC, which has the following main features:\nThe voltage reference of each DAC is provided at the VREFD or VREF pin.\rEach DAC has a flexible output update mechanism that allows seamless full-scale changes and supports jitter-free output updates.\rThe data and control interface between the MCU and each comparator and DAC are implemented through special registers\rThe main indicators of DAC: 12bit resolution:\nOutput setup time: 10us\rOutput voltage range: 0~VREF-1LSB\rOutput short circuit current: 15mA\rAnd we tried to use Tina simulation software to build a DAC module that can output stepped sine waves, so that we can verify the feasibility of subsequent modules on the software, especially the quality of the filtering effect.\nFilter module Generate a second-order Bessel low-pass filter through filter pro, and the parameter settings are as shown in the figure below.\nThis circuit module generates a clock signal, DACO generates a ladder signal, inputs an eighth-order ladder wave through DACO, and CLK inputs a clock signal of 100:1 (clock signal frequency: sinusoidal signal frequency) to achieve the function of the filter.\n(1) The signal frequency is adjustable. The signal frequency is controlled by changing the frequency of the ladder signal generated by DACO and changing the frequency of the signal in the CLK generation formula through program control.
